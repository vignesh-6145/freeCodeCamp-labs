# Pallindrome Checker - FreeCodeCamp JS challenge

this was one of five the challenges required to complete for the course  [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)


## About the challenge - Pallindrome Checker

the challenge was to implement a utility which can check whether the passed string was a Pallindrome or not

the constraints for this problem are
* The utility must exclusively take into account alphanumeric characters during the evaluation process.
* The functionality should be operational for strings regardless of their letter case.
* The function is designed to accept any character while ensuring its proper functionality.

### test cases 



- [x] palindrome("eye") should return a boolean
- [x] palindrome("eye") should return true
- [x] palindrome("_eye") should return true
- [x] palindrome("race car") should return true
- [x] palindrome("not a palindrome") should return false
- [x] palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal. Panama") should return true
- [x] palindrome("never odd or even") should return true
- [x] palindrome("nope") should return false
- [x] palindrome("almostomla") should return false
- [x] palindrome("My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.") should return true
- [x] palindrome("1 eye for of 1 eye.") should return false
- [x] palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0") should return true
- [x] palindrome("five|\_/|four") should return false
